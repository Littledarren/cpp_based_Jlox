# cpp_based_Jlox
an implementation of the jlox compiler, which is built in c++


The respected tutorial is [here](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) written by Bob  Nystrom.
It's an interesting and practical tutorial. I find it great to edit and run a self-made compiler. 

This project is created because I wanna practice my c++. And it is not complete compared to craftinginterpreters.com.
